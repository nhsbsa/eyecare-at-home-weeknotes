# Week ending: March 5th 

**We use weeknotes to involve people in our work and be transparent with our progress.**

Weeknotes highlight achievements and show progress, but also acknowledge things we’re worried about and what hasn't worked, so we can adapt and learn quickly from failure.

[Get in touch](mailto:victoria.hutchinson1@nhs.net) with the team with any questions or feedback.

## Good Things

> - What are the main highlights this week?
> - Have you hit any milestones, or overcome any significant blockers? 
> - What decisions have been made? 
> - Do you have any images to show progress? (e.g. a photo from a workshop, or a screenshot of something that’s been built?)

## Learned things

> - Have the team learned anything from a retro?
> - Did anything happen that you didn’t expect?
> - Have the team made any changes to how the team operates?
> - Have the team uncovered anything new from user research?
> - Does anyone from the team have any personal reflections that they’d like to share?

## Difficulties

> - What challenges or issues does the wider project team need to be aware of?
> - How are you dealing with them?
> - What help do you need - either from within the project team or elsewhere?

## Achievements

> - Are there any team achievements that need recognising?
> - Are there any individuals you want to recognise? (they don’t need to be inside the core project team - they could be someone from a different department who helped you out this week).

## What’s next

> - What key things or dates are coming up?
